This project was done with CoreNLP and we used
Intellij as our Java IDE.  The Classifier.java
has the main method while the helper classes we used
are in the POSParsing folder.

In order to run the code the user must import the
CoreNLP library into the project. The link can be found: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/

If the user is running the program through Intellij,
change the contents in sample.txt

else if the user is running the program through a command line prompt,
the following prompt should run the program

java -jar NLP_Watson_Prototype.jar input.txt

NOTE: NLP_Watson_prototype.jar and input.txt must be in the same directory in order to run properly.
